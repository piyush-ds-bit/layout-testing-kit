# 🌐 Personal Portfolio – Built Entirely Using AI (Lovable.ai)

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, a digital reflection of my learning journey, projects, and passion for **Machine Learning and Data Science**.  
What makes this portfolio special? It’s built **entirely using AI tools**, with **no prior experience in React or frontend development**.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As someone deeply passionate about becoming a **Data Scientist**, I wanted a place to:
- Showcase my projects, skills, and blogs
- Share my learning path with others
- Experiment with creative tech like AI-driven design
- Create an engaging experience — even adding a **randomly roaming bug 🐞** for fun!

Despite having zero frontend experience, I used **Lovable.ai**, my creativity, and well-crafted prompts to build a fully responsive, modern site — all by myself.

## 🌱 My Ongoing Mission

This portfolio is a **testament to the power of learning + creativity**.

I’m currently:
- 🌟 Learning core **ML algorithms** and data science techniques
- 🧠 Building ML projects using Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, and more
- 🔁 Constantly evolving and adding features to this site

📌 My dream is to become a **Data Scientist**, and I’m working day and night to make that dream real — through building, experimenting, and learning.

## 🔍 How It Was Built

> “I didn’t write a single line of frontend code manually.”

Instead:
- I used prompts and imagination.
- I guided Lovable.ai to bring the site to life.
- I connected the backend using Supabase.
- I deployed the site and polished every section myself.

🧠 _AI helped me code it, but **I envisioned it.**_

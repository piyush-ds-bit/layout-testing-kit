  fullIntroduction: `My name is Piyush Kumar Singh, and I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at Haldia Institute of Technology, batch 2023–2027.

I belong to a technical background, and over the last few years, I've developed a strong interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, and full-stack application development, which has now become the core direction of my career.

From the beginning of my college journey, I was always fascinated by how data can be used to solve real-world problems. This curiosity drove me to learn Python, along with essential data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and later TensorFlow. I gradually transitioned from basic analysis to building complete machine learning models and deploying them as interactive applications.`,
